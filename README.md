# Interfacing-Microcontroller-with-ADC
This project demonstrates the interfacing of an 8051 microcontroller with the ADC0809 (8-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter) to convert analog signals into digital values, which are then displayed on a 7-segment LED display. The firmware is developed using Keil µVision IDE.
